# Raspberry-Pi-Facial-Recognition
This is a lifesize humanoid based on the Inmoov 3D printed design. The link to the STL files will be linked below. The orginal design utiizes a custom pcb to interact with an arduino mega so that there are enough pins available for all the motors. I decided to go with an arduino mega and a shield that can supply the nesscary voltage and power to all the large servo motors. However for the head there is no sort of camera design for the eyes. I decided adjust 2 pieces in the eyes so that there is mobility in the eyes (can look up and down) then embedded a small raspberry pi camera with a ribbon wire in which the raspberry pi 3b can be mounted on the back of the humanoid. The facial recognition runs on tensorflow lite and requires the full 4 cores on the raspberry pi to be enabled otherwise you will get an error. Then you will need to run the face_dataset python file and point the camera at yourself in order to take 100 pictures that are converted to grayscale so tha
